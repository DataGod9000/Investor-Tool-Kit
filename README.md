Investor Toolkit: AI-Powered Investment Strategies 🚀📊

Welcome to The Investor Toolkit – a comprehensive suite of tools that harness AI, sentiment analysis, and technical trading strategies to empower smarter investment decisions. This project bridges data science and finance, providing actionable insights to optimize portfolios, analyze market sentiment, and execute efficient trading strategies.

🛠️ Features

1. Asset Clustering for Portfolio Optimization
	•	Uses K-Means clustering to group stocks based on returns and volatility.
	•	Visualizes clusters to identify diversified and high-performing portfolios.
	•	Incorporates sector analysis and evaluates performance metrics for optimal portfolio allocation.

2. Sentiment-Based Trading Bot
	•	Leverages social media sentiment analysis to predict stock price movements.
	•	Combines sentiment scores with market data to train machine learning models.
	•	Evaluates model performance (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost) for informed trading decisions.

3. MACD Pullback Strategy
	•	Implements a technical trading model for short-term scalping using MACD pullbacks.
	•	Detects pullbacks and identifies trend reversals for precise trading entries and exits.
	•	Validates the strategy with backtesting, achieving a 58% win rate and substantial net profit.

📊 How It Works
	1.	Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
	•	Utilizes the Yahoo Finance API and social media data for a robust dataset.
	•	Prepares data for accurate analysis, clustering, and modeling.
	2.	Portfolio Optimization:
	•	Clusters assets based on historical performance.
	•	Analyzes sector diversification and constructs balanced portfolios.
	3.	Sentiment and Price Movement Integration:
	•	Analyzes tweet sentiment using NLTK’s VADER and combines it with stock data.
	•	Tests models to predict price movements based on sentiment and market trends.
	4.	Backtesting:
	•	Simulates the performance of trading strategies using historical data.
	•	Validates results to refine models and ensure real-world applicability.
